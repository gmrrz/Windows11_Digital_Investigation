## Reflection and Professional Takeaways

This educational lab emphasized the importance of **forensic soundness, clarity, and verifiability**. Key lessons include:  

- Rely on **tool logs** as the objective record, avoiding unnecessary narrative.  
- Use **verified imaging tools** (`dcfldd`, `FTK Imager`) with **stream hashing** for integrity.  
- Keep documentation **minimal, factual, and consistent**‚Äîevery extra detail is potential risk.  
- Treat reports as **court-facing records**, prioritizing accuracy over exhaustive description.  

This reflection guides my approach from simply learning tools to practicing **professional, defensible forensic workflows**.
